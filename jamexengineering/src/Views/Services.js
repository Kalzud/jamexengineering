                                    Jamex aids rural areas and towns, particularly those where
                                    the national grid is unable to provide all the necessary electricity.
                                    We provide this assistance in the form of electricity delivered to
                                    rural communities to meet their electrical needs. At Jamex, we are
                                    conscious of the high cost of electrification in sparsely inhabited
                                    areas, so we offer services that utilise a hybrid system that makes
                                    the most of the national grid, solar energy, bioenergy, wind, etc.
                                    At Jamex, we take care to customise services to the needs and areas
                                    of deficiency of the community being electrified (whether it be healthcare,
                                    education, productivity, etc.). In addition to putting safety first when
                                    providing our services, we also follow industry rules to safeguard the
                                    community's and employees' safety. Another reason we ensure the use of
                                    cutting-edge technologies and creative approaches in our rural electrification
                                    is that we take great delight in creating with the possibility of future growth,
                                    development, and expansion in the community to lower the cost of upgrades along the road.
